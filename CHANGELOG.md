# Changelog

## 0.2.0-alpha.1

- Forked the DGX Spark-focused runtime as Persona Image Lab.
- Added private, read-only persona presets with optional prompt canon and up to
  ten combined preset/manual reference images.
- Simplified the default UI around character preset, prompt, reference images,
  canvas preset, and generation; low-level size/step/seed controls moved under
  Advanced.
- Added `./persona` as the primary Docker helper while retaining `./spark`
  for upstream compatibility.
- Renamed public Docker/runtime configuration to Persona Image Lab and documented
  the boundary between public application code and private character data.

  copies only after their final use.

- Prepare the project for its public alpha release with private vulnerability
  reporting guidance and patched versions of vulnerable packages inherited from

- Verify the installed model revision before inference and contain saved reference
  files even when the reference directory has been replaced by a symlink.
